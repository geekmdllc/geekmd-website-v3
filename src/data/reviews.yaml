        I had my baseline appointment with Dr. Nesbit yesterday and it 
        was absolutely amazing.

        I was fortunate to see Dr. Travis Nesbit. I spent what 
        seemed like almost an hour with this doctor talking 
        about my medical history and strategizing on my personal 
        treatment plan. During this time the doctor really 
        helped me with two things: 1) understanding my holistic 
        history and symptoms 2) prioritizing my treatment plan 
        based on my data, my preferences, and his medical 
        expertise. This made me feel like I'd started a 
        partnership beyond just being a patient.

        My doctor, Dr. Travis Nesbit, was knowledgeable about my 
        various medical conditions and provided insight on treatments 
        and their impacts / effects.  He was patient, asked 
        appropriate questions and made me feel at ease.   
        I could go on but let me conclude by saying, I developed 
        a trust on the process, advice and results
