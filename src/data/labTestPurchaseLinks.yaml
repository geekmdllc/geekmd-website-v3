        The thyroid is an absolutely essential organ for health and metabolism. Like most hormones, 
        more is not necessarily better. Balance is key. Too or too much can lead to side effects, 
        and at the extremes can be life threatening. TSH, or thyroid stimulating hormone, is the 
        primary hormone we monitor to analyze a persons thyroid function. It comes from the brain 
        and how much TSH your brain produces is based on feedback from the thyroid itself. T4, or 
        thyroxine, is the most abundant form of thyroid hormone in your body. This combination will 
        pickup most potential health concerns and is therefore highly cost effective.

        an intensive lifestyle overhaul, so this is an absolute must.

        Insulin is an incredibly important hormone. It is essential for moving very important
        macronutrients in and out of cells. Excesses of insulin relative to what would be 
        expected could indicate insulin resistance. Insulin resistance is the foundation of 
        type 2 diabetes, and is associated with many additional medical problems such as 
        heart attack, stroke, loss of limbs, cancer, and more.  Normally doctors will check 
        your blood glucose and Hemoglobin A1c in order to assess your diabetes risk. But, 
        they're often looking too late. You want to catch insulin resistance before it turns 
        into diabetes, not after.

        Testosterone is a vital hormone for both men and women. It influences energy levels, 
        sleep quality, sex drive, body composition, and muscle-building. Contrary to popular 
        belief, there is evidence by a recent Veterans Affairs study in males which suggest 
        levels that are too low, and not treated, are more dangerous to a persons overall 
        health than being on testosterone replacement therapy. So, if you're found to be low,
        you should be able to reap the benefits without feeling guilty. Poor lifestyle 
        conditions and body composition can lead to low testosterone levels.

        therapy are often surprised to learn that low levels of estrogen and high levels of 
        estrogen can really hurt their life quality, effectively limiting or even nullifying 
        the benefits of the testosterone replacement therapy. True to form with hormones,

        A lipid panel is a set of lab tests looking at how much cholesterol can be found 
        in the various lipoprotein particles in your body that are responsible for carrying
        it. Both the total volume and distribution of cholesterol in these lipoprotein 
        particles can indicate risk for various forms of cardiovascular disease such as 
        heart attack and stroke. Triglycerides are also included in a lipid panel and they
        represent free floating fatty particles. High triglyceride levels are also associated 
        with many poor health outcomes, but one that can be acutely life threatening is severe
        pancreatitis.
