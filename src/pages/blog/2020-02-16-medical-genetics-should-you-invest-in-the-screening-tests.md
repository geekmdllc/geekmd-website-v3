## An Important Preface

If you're reading this, please take a look at the date it was published. It's conceivable that every word written will be out-dated in relatively short order. **Medical genetics is a rapidly evolving field at the moment.** 

## What is Medical Genetic Testing?

This is an **incredibly broad** question. Therefore, it's entirely appropriate to start with. We have to define the scope of this blog post. 

Broadly speaking, genetic testing is well described by the [U.S. National Library of Medicine's Genetics Home Reference](https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/primer/testing/genetictesting):

> Genetic testing is a type of medical test that identifies changes in chromosomes, genes, or proteins. The results of a genetic test can confirm or rule out a suspected genetic condition or help determine a personâ€™s chance of developing or passing on a genetic disorder. More than 1,000 genetic tests are currently in use, and more are being developed.

Some of these genetic tests are considered to be invaluable.  And, some are also incredibly inaccessible at the moment with monumentally high costs and of minuscule potential benefit to the average person. 

## Monogenic Disorders

Genetic testing for monogenic disorders is something many people will actually have some loose familiarity with. And, these are some of the most clinically useful tests available. 

**Prior to pregnancy** at-risk couples will often have their own genes tested to see if they are both carriers for dangerous genes that can be passed on to their children and cause diseases such as:

* [CFTR](https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/CFTR) - [Cystic fibrosis](https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/cystic-fibrosis)
* [HBB](https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/HBB) - [Sickle cell disease](https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/sickle-cell-disease#genes)
* [FMR1](https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/FMR1)- [Fragile X Syndrome](https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/fragile-x-syndrome#genes)
* And, more...

Some families are riddled with cancer such as breast cancer, or colon cancer. And, adults who are concerned for their health and those of their children can be tested for genes such as: 

* [BRCA](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/genetics/brca-fact-sheet) - [Breast Cancer](https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/breast-cancer#genes)
* [APC](https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/APC) - [Colon Cancer (Familiar Adenomatous Polyposis)](https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/familial-adenomatous-polyposis#genes)
* And, more...

And, other families may have monstrously high cholesterol values and a history of tragically early heart attacks from a disease like [familial hypercholesterolemia](https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/familial-hypercholesterolemia#genes) due to mutations in the following genes:

* [APOB](https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/APOB)
* [LDLR](https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/LDLR)
* [LDLRAP1](https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/LDLRAP1)
* [PCSK9](https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/PCSK9)

Now, the thing that these monogenic disorders all have in common is that they're relatively simple to interpret. **Mono** means one, or singular. The presence of a single gene confers a big risk. In a way, these are what you'd call black-or-white cases. 

**The thing about these tests is that people are usually getting them precisely because their family has seen a string of cases run through the family tree**. If a family has a history of women developing breast cancer at an early age, that's a pretty good indicator that testing for the disease is necessary and important. On the contrary, it's quite rare for a person to sporadically develop mutations in the BRCA-1 or BRCA-2 genes which would lead to an increased risk of cancer.  The same goes for heart disease. A person with familial hypercholesterolemia is likely to have an idea that their family members have early heart attacks and strokes.

However, **breast cancer, heart disease, and more are all common diseases that are rarely caused by the above genes.** And, you see those diseases popping up in people who lack those clear-cut family histories.

## Polygenic Disorders

People without extensive family histories of cystic fibrosis, etc. generally don't spend their days worrying about it. I can vouch for this as a clinician who spent years asking people about their concerns. They tend to worry about heart disease, cancer, diabetes, and associated diseases. And, these are **primarily polygenic diseases**. As a side note, I may have led you astray by using cancer examples above, but while there are monogenic mutations that lead to cancerous disease, **most cases of cancer are sporadic.**

Polygenic disorders are far more complex than monogenic disorders. You likely either already knew, or have already guessed it, but **poly** stands for many. **How many? We often have no idea. And, we may not ever** be able to fully account for every gene and gene variant going into a polygenic disease risk. 

Just think about the numbers. **The human [genome](https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/primer/hgp/genome) is over 3,000,000,000 (3 billion) building blocks** known as nucleotide base pairs. In those 3 billion, **there are 180,000 different genes expressed** in the human [exome](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/exome) that ultimately turn into the proteins that make up our bodies. Those 180,000 genes make up about 1% o the human genome, or 0.01 times 3,000,000,000. That's 30,000,000 (30 million) nucleotide base pairs spread out over 180,000 genes. That means that **on average there are 166 building blocks in every single gene**. And, any one of those building blocks being changed has the potential to negatively or positively impact the protein that's produced, and also has the opportunity to interact with the rest of the exome and genome (yes, DNA interacts with itself) in a way that can potentially negatively or positive impact a person's health and longevity. **It is simply mind-numbing**. 

For that reason **polygenic diseases are way behind monogenic diseases in the world of medical genetics.** That is, if you're looking to identify your genetic risk of heart disease, diabetes, cancer, etc. any test that looks at a single gene, or more likely [single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)](https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/primer/genomicresearch/snp) is going to be much less powerful than people assume when they think about genetic testing, something that's innately associated with precision

For example, cardiovascular disease is the number one killer of adults in the US. One person dies every 37 seconds from cardiovascular disease in the US [according to the CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/heartdisease/facts.htm). Yet, in order to get an idea of a persons cardiovascular disease risk you have to create a **polygenic risk score** by **looking at the entire human genome**. As of now, **we have identified over 100 different areas in the genome associated with cardiovascular disease**. And, these genes taken together and [parsed through a fancy polygenic risk score](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCGEN.119.002481) is what's required to discover risk similar to what you might find in a single [LDLR mutation](https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/LDLR#conditions) listed above. 

## Direct-to-Consumer Tests

There are a number of direct-to-consumer tests available these days which make impressive claims. [23andMe](https://www.23andme.com/),  [Futura Genetics](https://www.futuragenetics.com/), and [Color](https://www.color.com/) just to name a few. The first two look at [single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)](https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/primer/genomicresearch/snp), and the latter looks at whole genes. They can all be acquired relatively inexpensively. I've seen prices ranging from $59 to $249, making them quite accessible. 

Generally speaking, these are, however, not the tests you use to identify familial health conditions that seem to run through the family tree like wildfire. Those are generally coordinated through a geneticist of specialist physician.

### Problems with Direct-to-Consumer Tests (DTC's)

There are plenty of problems with DTC's. The major problem with a direct-to-consumer test (DTC) is that they're direct to consumers. The results are very challenging to put into context, and they can also be outright misleading.

#### Context is Everything

If your report tells you that you're at increased risk of diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, or any other disease what does that even mean? In almost all cases, it surely doesn't mean you have no control. Yet, that's' what many people end up thinking. And, these tests are often very anxiety-provoking for people. I have seen people order DTC's, run them through interpretive programs, such as [Promethease](https://promethease.com/) which pulls data from [SNPedia](https://www.snpedia.com/index.php/SNPedia), and become absolutely distraught when they read the results. 

Sadly, they are distraught for little to no reason. They misinterpret the results and they don't get to see everyone else's report. I've seen literally hundreds of genetic reports from these DTC's. Nearly uniformly people's reports, especially when run through these DNA interpretation programs, identify heart disease and cancer risk that looks outright scary. This is simply a result of two things:

1. Heart disease and cancer are the two most common killers in the world, so it's literally no surprise when you've got risk factors for them. Basically everyone does. It's the combination of many risk factors, which these tools don't do effectively, that would allow us to determine your individual risk with some degree of precision.
2. Lifestyle is still generally far more important than genes in the vast majority of cases. 

#### Misleading Claims

23andMe famously advertises their BRCA1/BRCA2 results from their genetic testing. So, a person who may be concerned of their breast cancer risk due to BRCA may order a 23andMe test and see the *negative* result for their BRCA and feel a sense of relief. However, 23andMe doesn't look for whole genes. It looks for those little tiny changes within genes called SNP's. And, it doesn't look for all possible SNP's. So, it's only going to report a small number of BRCA cases. It's very insensitive to finding the disease.

This is their [small print](https://www.23andme.com/brca/):

> The BRCA1/BRCA2 (Selected Variants) Genetic Health Risk report is not a comprehensive genetic BRCA test, does not diagnose cancer, and should not be used to make medical decisions. **More than 1,000 variants** in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes are known to increase our cancer risk. **Our report only includes 3 of those variants**. These three variants are most common in people of Ashkenazi Jewish descent and are much less common in people of other ethnicities.

**You read that right. They test for 0.3% of all BRCA variants and advertise the BRCA screening that exists primarily in a group of people that makes up 1.5% of the population.** I'm sorry, but 23andMe covering themselves legally by including a small disclaimer in the fine print doesn't absolve them for marketing it as they do. It's clearly predatory and has probably cost some people late diagnoses which could lead to death; although that's clearly speculation on my part I think the odds are good.

They also famously advertise their ability to detect Alzheimer's disease. However, like many polygenic diseases, a reasonably accurate prediction [requires the whole human genome](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30911569) to be sequenced and processed. And, 23andMe only looks at a tiny subset of the human genome. My calculations suggest they [review roughly 0.04 to 0.2% of your DNA](https://isogg.org/wiki/Autosomal_SNP_comparison_chart) depending on the test you took. Admittedly, these are targeted and they likely represent a much larger useful fraction of your whole genome, but it's still underwhelming on the whole.

### DTC's: Are they really all that bad?

Not entirely. 

They're doing many good services. One by reducing the costs of genetic testing, and two some of the tests are actually useful. **Color is pretty straightforward because it's looking at monogenic diseases. And, they have physicians reviewing the test results**.  

Additionally, some people simply get scared straight. It's not my preferred method of coaxing people into healthier living, but so long as they're not clinically depressed by the results a win is a win (this is at least half jest). 

## The million dollar question: should you invest in a genetic test?

As of right now, I personally have not chosen to invest significantly into genetic testing. I do not personally feel it's valuable enough to me to be worth the risk. I personally feel that, since genes are fixed, and since I do not have any family history of these monogenic diseases that it would not be worth my time, money, and effort.

As for you, I am sorry, but I cannot tell you if it's worth it to you. If you have a history of health issues that runs strongly in your family, show your doctor some of the genetic tests you're interested in and have a discussion with them about whether or not they feel they can use that information to improve your life. 

In most cases you will not live any longer for knowing the information. In most cases you can optimize your life quality and longevity through less technical means that require a lot more hard work.

However, I think this will change rapidly. We're on the precipice of clinically useful genetic medicine. True to my goal of delivering precision wellness, I'll be watching the development of polygenic risk scores and looking for clues on how to leverage them in a clinical context for my patients and in a non-clinical context for my online clients.
