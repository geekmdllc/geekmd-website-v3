## Geek Defined

The [YourDictionary.com](https://www.yourdictionary.com/geek) definition of a geek is:

> a slang word for a computer expert, someone who loves computers or someone who is
> socially or physically awkward.

There are many other definitions, mostly pejorative. However, this is the most appropriate
in a modern context.

## Background

Being a health care worker, especially a clinician, is an honor and privilege in many ways.
It's not just cliche, people entrust clinicians their most intimate life details.

Unfortunately, **people tend to hate going to the doctors office**. And, for good reason: it sucks!

The medical staff are often rushed and/or grumpy, people have to wait long periods of time,
the care is subpar, and it costs an arm-and a leg to get these incredibly frustrating services.
What is there to like? This **is not** an exaggeration.

> Three main categories of reasons for avoiding medical care were identified.

> health care organizations, and affective concerns. Second, a subset of
> participants reported low perceived need to seek medical care (12.2%),
> often because they expected their illness or symptoms to improve over time
> (4.0%). Third, many participants reported traditional barriers to medical
> care (58.4%), such as high cost (24.1%), no health insurance (8.3%), and
> time constraints (15.6%). We developed a conceptual model of medical care
> avoidance based on these results. - [Taber et al. (2015)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4351276/)

So, yes, health care delivery just sucks.

The big question though, is: **why does health care delivery suck**?

It's a complete mess, that's why. Approximately [34% of all health care costs are
administrative](https://time.com/5759972/health-care-administrative-costs/)
in nature. That's incredible!

Physicians also work at least about 50 hours per week including 1 to 2 hours
each evening in their personal time finishing work, and [only spend 27% of
their time working with patients](https://www.healio.com/primary-care/practice-management/news/online/%7B063320c8-6954-45b8-89dc-3b293772d441%7D/physicians-spend-nearly-50-of-their-time-on-ehr-desk-work)!

So, not only do paitents hate it, so do doctors. In fact, it's been reported about
[70% of physicians would **not recommend** their career to others](https://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/why-70-percent-physicians-would-not-recommend-profession).

## Purpose

This is where Travis Nesbit, MD (GeekMD), comes in. He is resolved to be part of the solution.

The solution to the disaster in health care where we lose too much clinician-patient time, and spend too much
money on administrative burden is technology. Specifically, we need more leaders working at the interface
between health care and technology.
