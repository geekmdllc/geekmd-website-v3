## What is elevated blood pressure?

Blood pressure refer's to the pressure exerted by blood
onto the walls of the arteries. **Elevated blood pressure**
is know to medical doctors and other clinicians as
**hypertension**. And, the counterpart to hypertension is
hypotension, where blood pressure is too low. Both problems
can be deadly, but high blood pressure is a much more common
occurence in the US and much of the rest of the world.

### What's the problem with elevated blood pressure? Let's demonstrate with a simple analogy.

People's vital organs have all been finely crafted through
millions of years of evolution to operate within a specific
range of blood pressure. **The reason why is not as complicated
as it might seem, and is fairly analagous to setting up a
sprinkler system** in ones yard. So, let's continue with that
analogy.

When installing a sprinkler system you need be able to deliver
enough water to your grass to keep it alive and healthy. **Too
much water means you'll end up flooding your grass, killing it. And, too
little means you'll end up dehydrating your grass, killing it**.
This is partially controlled by placing the sprinklers in the right
location. But, it's also controlled by water pressure. If the pressure is too high, then a sprinkler might burst and simply flood the grass
out. If the water pressure is too low, you end up with a watershed
area of dead grass where the water could not reach.

### High blood pressure in a human. Also bad, just a whole lot worse.

When humans live with high blood pressure, they usually have no idea.
Rather than the grass starting to dry out, a huge water bill, or a flooded backyard, you get **a complete lack of symptoms**. That is why
**high blood pressure is known as the silent killer**.

The high pressures can cause immediate, and catastrophic deaths such as
brain bleeds, torn or exploded aorta, and more. However, it's generally
a more insidious process chewing years off your life. It's damaging
heart, brain, kidney, eye, limb, and other tissues as they suffer a
24/7/365 onslaught of blunt force trauma a heart beat at a time. **Ultimately this leads to outcomes such as heart attack, stroke, kidney failure**, and more.

We're going to depart from the background information here to learn
about why people have high blood pressure, and what they can do about
it. If you'd like more information on high blood pressure, please
see this excellent page by the [Center for Disease Control](https://www.cdc.gov/bloodpressure/facts.htm).

## Why is my blood pressure elevated? And, what can I do about it?

> Do not ever accept a diagnosis of hypertension from a

> your own best advocate! - Dr. T

The causes of high blood pressure are numerous. In fact, too many to
touch on in great detail in this blog post. There are entire books
dedicated to the topic. But, here are the most common causes:

1. Primary (essesntial) hypertension
2. Prescription medications
3. Over-the-counter medications
4. Recreational drugs
5. Primary aldosteronism
6. Renovascular hypertension
7. Obstructive sleep apnea
8. Pheochromocytoma
9. Cushing's syndrome
10. Hypothyroidism
11. Hyperthyroidism
12. Hyperparathyroidism
13. And, more...

Chances are, if you've got high blood pressure the reason is up there
in that list. This is an incredibly important concept and cannot be
overstated.

### A focused list of causes of hypertension. Let's make this easier to digest.

While there are many causes of high blood pressure, there are a couple
that are the overwhelming majority.

#### Essential Hypertension - Most Cases

Essential hypertension is what we call elevated blood pressure
that has not been ascribed a cause. Some people mistakenly
assume this is solely genetic. It is not.

It is my belief, and admittedly this is conjecture, that the
reason we have 90% of all cases of hypertension identified as
essential hypertension is because **doctors don't have the time
necessary to do a good job investigating the cause**! We have
so little time with patients, it's just easier to write a
prescription and be to your next patient. **I'm not smashing
doctors here, the problem is the system**.

[The American Heart Association](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/01.cir.101.3.329) hints to as much in their own publication. With regard to essential hypertension Carretero and Oparil note:

> A number of factors increase BP, including (1) obesity, (2) insulin
> resistance, (3) high alcohol intake, (4) high salt intake (in
> salt-sensitive patients), (5) aging and perhaps (6) sedentary
> lifestyle, (7) stress, (8) low potassium intake, and (9) low calcium
> intake. Furthermore, many of these factors are additive, such as
> obesity and alcohol intake.

Looking at this more closely, we can see that many of these implicated
causes are fully lifestyle controllable. And, therefore **essential
hypertension is not simply genetic** in most cases. The only thing on
that list which cannot be controlled is age. Now, genetics may indeed
play a role. But, they're not the only thing.

#### Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) - The most common secondary cause

Sleep apnea comes in two variations. Central sleep apnea is far less common, and is the brain forgetting to send the signal to cause a
person to breath. We will not focus on this. **Obstructive sleep apnea**
is incredibly common in the US because it is strongly weight-associated.

The correlation between obstructive sleep apnea and high blood
pressure is very strong. According to a 2017 paper published in the [International Journal of Hypertension](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5632858/):

> The prevalence of hypertension in OSA patients is estimated
> between 30 and 70%.

The precise pathogenesis of elevated blood pressure caused by
obstructive sleep apnea is complex. However, suffice it to say
that **the significant amount of time your body goes without
fresh oxygen while sleeping due to the blockage of the airway
by, usually, fatty soft tissues wreaks havoc on internal organs.**

This is **precisely why your doctor should find a cause** for you
high blood pressure. Note that I used the plural form **organs**.
High blood pressure is just a single manifestation of obstructive
sleep apnea. If you simply cover it up with a medication rather
than identifying, and treating, the root cause you'll still be
suffering damage from the low oxygen state that is **not** remedied
by the blood pressure medication.

## Treating Your High Blood Pressure

Treatment for your high blood pressure will vary wildly
depending on cause. A person with a hyperactive thyroid
or parathyroid hormone may ultimately need surgery. A person
with obustructive sleep apnea may only need to lose some
weight. Or, you might have a person with a mixed set of
conditions contributing to the state of high blood pressure
that needs to be attacked from multiple angles. So, we'll
keep it generic here and focused on the top two causes only.
If you and your doctor are able to identify a different
cause, there are algorithms for treating each of the above
causes of high blood pressure.

### Lifestyle Optimization

Lifestyle optimization is absolutely the best treatment
option for most people, and is generally the only cure
for causes of hypertension that don't require surgical
removal of hormonally active tissues.

- Lose weight
- Reduce alcohol intake
- Exercise more
- Reduce stress
- Test your bodies intake of salt
- Consider cutting back, or out, caffeine
- If you smoke, stop

Whether you've got essential hypertension, or secondary
hypertension caused by a number of the above-listed
pathologies, including obstructive sleep apnea,
lifestyle optimization is likely to help reduce your
blood pressure.

We understand this is easier said that done - especially
when attempting to do it in a sustainable fashion. So,
if you'd like to get started but struggle to do it on
your own, by all means acquire some help. If you want to
work with me, Dr. T, please reach out! This is my passion!

### Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) Machine

This one is obstructive sleep apnea specific. Many cases of
highly resistant sleep apnea, meaning not responding to
medications, are caused by obstructive sleep apnea. A CPAP
machine forces air through the soft-tissue blockages in your
airway enhancing the quality of your sleep and often improving
or even normalizing blood pressure.

I understand that CPAP machines are undesirable. So, step #1 should
always be to see if you can lose enough weight to eliminate
the sleep apnea. But, if that doesn't work, you'll want to try
to open up your airway using a CPAP.

The effects of the CPAP are very quick, have a statistically significant impact on mean blood pressure, and they have an [extra-powerful benefit](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3927443/) on the important nighttime blood pressure's **nocturnal dip**:

> This difference was more evident during the night, with a decrease
> of 7.1 mm Hg (p = 0.003) in nocturnal SBP and 4.1 mm Hg (p = 0.003)
> in nocturnal DBP.

### Medications - Yes, they have utility too.

If your blood pressure is sufficiently high (read: scary),
you have high risk for cardiovascular disease, or
you have not had success acheiving a healthy blood pressure
using lifestyle alone, you'll want to consider blood pressure
medications.

#### What blood pressure is considered elevated enough to require medication?

This is a matter of debate. There are the [JNC 8 Guidelines](https://www.aafp.org/afp/2014/1001/p503.html), which
some may consider the gold standard. However, I feel they're a little
too reductionist.

There is an excellent group of experts who contribute to the
world-renown clinical resource [UpToDate](https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hypertension-in-adults?search=hypertension%20treatment&sectionRank=3&usage_type=default&anchor=H862716997&source=machineLearning&selectedTitle=2~150&display_rank=2#H3639365205) who have created a set of guidelines
I feel is more appropiate.

#### Any patient, whether or not there is any other medical issue, is likely to benefit from these guidelines:

- Home blood pressures readings averaging &ge; 135 mmHg systolic, or &ge; 85 mmHg diastolic.
- Office blood pressure readings averaging &ge; 140 mmHg systolic, or &ge; 90 mmHg diastolic.

#### Patients with clinical cardiovascular diesease, diabetes, kidney disease, age of 65 years or older, or an estimated 10-year risk of cardiovascular disease &ge; 10 percent will likely benefit from these guidelines:

- Home blood pressure readings averaging &ge; 130 mmHg systolic, or &ge; 80 mmHg diastolic.
- Office blood pressure readings averaging &ge; 130 mmHg systolic, or &ge; 80 mmHg diastolic.

NOTE: your doctor can calculate your 10-year risk of heart attack
or stroke using the [Pooled Cohort Equation](http://tools.acc.org/ASCVD-Risk-Estimator-Plus/#!/calculate/estimate/) tool provided by the [American College of Cardiology](http://tools.acc.org/ASCVD-Risk-Estimator-Plus/#!/calculate/estimate/).

Again, **this is about starting a conversation** and isn't a paternal
demand. If you are in that second group of patients with those
pre-existing or high-risk states, I would think very, very hard
about starting medications to both reduce your already high risk
and because some of them, like medications of the ACE inhibitor class,
will also help prevent complications in some of the associated
conditions you're likely to either already have or develop.

## That was a lot, so let's summarize

Elevated blood pressure is a major cause of health complications
and death. And, it's silent. So, you'll want to be proactive.

If you've been diagnosed with high blood pressure, work with
your doctor to try to investigate **why** your blood pressure is
elevated. That likely involves asking them to look into the
possibility of obstructive sleep apnea, at a minimum. But, hopefully
a more thorough analysis of your health will be performed.
Once your cause has been identified, if possible, you'll
want to treat the specific cause under the care of your doctor.

Most cases of high blood pressure will respond well to
lifestyle optimization, which often includes more exercise and
weight loss.

If you have obstructive sleep apnea, you'll want to talk to your
doctor about a CPAP machine.

If you cannot get your blood pressure under control with lifestyle,
or if you have risk factors, you'll want to talk to your doctor
about potentially starting medications to reduce the risk of
major organ damage and death from high blood pressure.
