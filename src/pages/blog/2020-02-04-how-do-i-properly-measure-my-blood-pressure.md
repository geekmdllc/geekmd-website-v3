## Misdiagnosis of elevated blood pressure is a problem

It's been estimated that [millions of people](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/health/news/8339545/Millions-of-high-blood-pressure-patients-are-wrongly-diagnosed.html) have been improperly diagnosed with elevated blood pressure. This has, unfortuantely, been largely driven by a
case of operator error. Medical offices make people anxious, and
the workers are often moving people through the
production-line-like offices quickly.

Before you're either given a blood pressure medication that
you do not need, and potentially subjecting you to side effects
that were not worth the risk, or before missing an opportunity
to have potentially life-extending or life-saving blood pressure
medications prescribed, take the opportunity to learn how to
properly check your blood pressure yourself.

## The proper way to check blood pressure

### Step 1

Ensure you have a blood pressure cuff. They can be
acquired for a relatively small fee at most convenience stores
or online stores. I've seen some for as little as \$29.

### Step 2

Find a nice comfortable place to sit. You'll want the environment
to be free of stimulation and stress. Preferrably a quiet place.

### Step 3

Apply the blood pressure cuff to your upper arm. Make sure to
properly align the **artery line** on the cuff with your
brachial artery, which is on the inside of the arm near the bicep.

### Step 4

Wait. Do not start the machine! You'll want to wait for a
minimum of five minutes, but preferrably up to ten minutes.
Allow your body to come to a complete state of rest.

### Step 5

Press the start button, and wait.

## The Numbers - What do they mean?

### Systolic Blood Pressure - the top

Systolic blood pressure is the pressure your blood puts on
your artery walls, and therefore your organs, when the heart is
at it's strongest point of contraction.

### Diastolic Blood Pressure - the bottom

Diastolic blood pressure is the presure your blood puts on
your artery walls when the heart is at complete relaxation.

### Reading the numbers

The numbers will be presented as systolic/diastolic mmHg,
where mmHg reads "millimeters of mercury", a way of accounting
the pressure. Therefore, a reading of 125/85 mmHg would read
as one-hundred-twenty-five over eight-five millimeters of
mercury.

## Additional Notes

The above is the proper protocol for checking blood pressure.
However, there are a few more things to consider.

### One read isn't always enough.

Ideally, you'll take the average of three reads. This
would be laborious if you did it with every single blood
pressure check. So, this makes more sense to be sporadically
included in your home blood pressure check routine if
you've already been diagnosed with hypertension. If you're
being investigated for potentially having hypertension,
then it makes sense to do it with every blood pressure check.

### The arms aren't always even -- check both!

For various reasons, people's arterial anatomy isn't identical
from one side to the other. So, it's important to intermittently
check both arms and ensure they're relatively close in pressure.
If your two arms are not identical, ensure that the higher blood
pressure is the one that represents what your vital organs are
experiencing. Do not average both arms like you would a single
arm over multiple reads.

### Use the right size blood pressure cuff

Blood pressure cuffs are sized. And, proper sizing is required
for a good result. Please read your machine's instructions and
ensure that your cuff is the proper size.

### Blood pressure changes through the course of the day, and the course of the night.

You'll want to check your blood pressure at different times of day to get a better idea of what your blood pressure is on
average. It's great if your blood pressure is low in the
morning, but if it rises as soon as you get to work and
stays that way for 12 hours, that's no good! Additionally,
a healthy blood pressure should actually dip in the middle
of the night. It wouldn't hurt to check for the so-called
**nocturnal dip** on rare occasions. It can indicate a
number of other unhealthy processes, or even mask the
existence of high blood pressure that's damaging organs
uder the radar.
