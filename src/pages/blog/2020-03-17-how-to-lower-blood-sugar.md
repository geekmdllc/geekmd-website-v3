  Lowering your blood sugar is actually far simpler than one might imagine. And,
  there is great science to back this up. Keep in mind, simple doesn't mean
  easy. But, if you're looking to reduce your blood sugar, likely because you're
  diabetic, pre-diabetic, or at risk, then Dr. T helps you understand how you
  can do it effectively.

## Before ‘How’, let’s start with ‘Why’

So then, WHY do we want to lower blood sugar? It’s simple.

Approximately [34.2 million American’s have diabetes](https://www.diabetes.org/resources/statistics/statistics-about-diabetes), and [88 million American’s have pre-diabetes](https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/basics/prediabetes.html#:~:text=) in the US. Those numbers are shocking. Diabetes [is the number one cause](https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/basics/diabetes.html#:~:text=) of:

1. Kidney failure
2. Lower-limb amputations
3. Blindness for adults
4. And, more

Not to mention, it has a nasty propensity to increase blood pressure, heart attacks, stroke, and more.

So, the WHY question is very easy. Blood sugar increases leads to pre-diabetes and diabetes, and it is a train wreck for your body. Lowering blood sugar can improve your life by eliminating the diabetes risk, curing existing pre-diabetes, curing existing diabetes, reducing medications needed, or even just reducing damage to critical organs even if not eliminating diabetes.

## So then, How do we Lower Blood Sugar?

This is a question that requires a bit more focus. So, let’s start broad and work our way in. Here are all of the reasonable methods I’m aware of to reduce blood sugar levels.

1. Medications
2. Over-the-counter supplements
3. Improve diet
4. Increase muscle
5. Decrease fat
6. Increase exercise

I will work under the assumption that most people are not arriving here to learn extensively about pharmaceutical options. So, I’ll only touch on that briefly and then move on to the other sections.

### Medications

There are a whole bunch of medications that are used for the treatment of elevated blood sugar. But, generally only once a diagnosis of pre-diabetes, or diabetes mellitus has been made.

Of those medications, most are best used on a strictly-as-needed basis in my opinion. And, when I work with my patient’s (clinical practice, not as a health coach) I reserve them as such due to the extensive side effect profiles many of them come with, and specifically the risk of blood sugar that is too low, known as hypoglycemia.

However, there is one medication I often recommend strongly that people consider. This medication is sold under the generic name of metformin.

#### Metformin

![A set of pills representing prescription medications.](/img/og_pills.jpg "A set of pills representing prescription medications.")

Metformin reduces the rate of heart attacks in diabetics. I feel it’s fair to extrapolate this to pre-diabetics as well, since diabetes and pre-diabetes are the same disease (insulin resistance) just of different degrees.

> [Metformin reduces](https://cardiab.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12933-019-0900-7#:~:text=) cardiovascular mortality, all-cause mortality and \[cardiovascular] events in \[coronary artery disease] patients. For \[heart attack] patients and \[coronary artery disease] patients without \[type 2 diabetes mellitus], metformin has no significant effect of reducing the incidence of \[cardiovascular] events. Metformin has a better effect of reducing the incidence of \[cardiovascular] events than sulfonylureas.

Metformin is strongly associated with reduced rates of very dangerous types of cancer:

> [The use of metformin](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4200668/), the most commonly prescribed drug for type 2 diabetes, was repeatedly associated with the decreased risk of the occurrence of various types of cancers, especially of pancreas and colon and hepatocellular carcinoma

Metformin has been demonstrated to increase the lifespan of diabetes, and several animal models. Because of this, as of right now, it’s actually undergoing clinical trials in otherwise healthy humans to see if it has the same benefit there.

> [Metformin, an FDA approved first-line drug](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02432287) for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, has known beneficial effects on glucose metabolism. Evidence from animal models and in vitro studies suggest that in addition to its effects on glucose metabolism, metformin may influence metabolic and cellular processes associated with the development of age-related conditions, such as inflammation, oxidative damage, diminished autophagy, cell senescence and apoptosis. As such, metformin is of particular interest in clinical translational research in aging since it may influence fundamental aging factors that underlie multiple age-related conditions.

So, we’re talking about a medication that reduces cardiovascular risk, reduces cancer risk, and likely will make you live longer whether or not you have diabetes. It’s fair to say, I ask my patients to think long and hard about whether or not they think they could benefit from it.

### Over-the-Counter Supplements

Yes, you’ve read that right. It’s not witch-craft or simple hopefulness. There are actually some over-the-counter (OTC) supplements which do a quite good job reducing blood sugar. Now, they’re not research-proven to provide all of the same benefits as many pharmaceuticals. So, always talk to your doctor about your choices, but in all reality simply reducing your blood sugar is likely to have a big impact on your overall health trajectory.

I will only discuss those medications that have some good science behind them.

#### Improving Deficiencies or Imbalances

1. Probiotics
2. Fiber
3. Vitamin D

#### Supplements with Other Pharmacologic Benefits

1. Cinnamon
2. Fenugreek
3. Ginger
4. Garlic
5. Berberine

![Ginger root next to ginger capsules, and excellent supplement for reducing blood sugar. ](/img/og_ginger_caps_plant_.jpg "Ginger root next to ginger capsules, and excellent supplement for reducing blood sugar. ")

Going into great detail about each of these supplements is out of the scope of this blog post. However, I’d like to quickly highlight that I’m most fond of a combination of probiotics, fiber, about 4,000 IU/day of Vitamin D2 or D3, and [ginger at 1.5 to 3 grams per day](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5818945/).

Also note that supplements are not without their own side effects. Berberine, in particular, can be quite upsetting to the gastrointestinal tract of some people. Be sure to run any supplement changes by a qualified care provider before making changes.

### Improve Diet

This is the part that I’m sure you want me to tell you what the BEST diet is for improving blood sugar levels. Well, I will. And, then I will again… with a more reasonable answer.

#### The Technical Answer

A [2018 meta-analysis](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5871653/) (looking at a large number of studies) looked at the comparative effects of improving blood sugar control for patients with type 2 diabetes. The following was observed with regards to reductions in hemoglobin A1c%, a proxy measure for average blood sugar:

1. Low carbohydrate diet
2. Mediterranean diet
3. Paleolithic diet (only one study, interpret with caution)
4. Vegetarian
5. Low Glycemic Index
6. Moderate Carbohydrate
7. High-Protein
8. Low-Fat

However, the difference between the different strategies was relatively minimal and those differences shrink over the long-term. On top of that, it really seems to be primary driven by weight.

#### The Reasonable Answer

![A person performing meal prep. ](/img/og_meal_prep.jpg "A person performing meal prep. ")

A [2017 study compared standard diabetes care versus weight loss](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(17)33102-1/fulltext) with an end-point of diabetes remission. And, weight loss was strongly associated with diabetes remission.

1. 0% of the patients who gained weight achieved diabetes remission.
2. 7% of the patients who lost 0 - 5 kg achieved diabetes remission.
3. 34% of the patients who lost 5-10 kg achieved diabetes remission.
4. 57% of the patients who lost 10-15 kg achieved diabetes remission.
5. 86% of the patients who lost 15kg or more achieved diabetes remission.

![A bar graph showing the increased rate of diabetes remission with weight loss. ](/img/dm_remission_vs_weight_loss_graph.jpg "A bar graph showing the increased rate of diabetes remission with weight loss. ")

So, the reasonable answer is thatit really doesn’t matter that much which diet you choose. Just lose the weight! And, you don’t even really have to choose a diet at all so long as you lose the weight. And, furthermore, losing weight is still a fairly shotgun approach. Taking a precision wellness approach can yield even better results. Rather than simply “losing weight” you really want to improve all elements of your body composition as you can make even more progress.

### Increase Muscle

![A woman preparing to perform a dead lift. ](/img/og_woman_about_to_deadlift.jpg "A woman preparing to perform a dead lift. ")

In short, muscle consumes A LOT of energy. And, that energy in the bloodstream comes from blood sugar. In addition, muscle actually has an insulin-independent blood sugar (glucose) update mechanism. So, it can do it to some degree even without insulin, an important feature for people with high sugar who have insulin resistance by default.

[A 2019 study](https://www.mayoclinicproceedings.org/article/S0025-6196(18)30789-4/abstract) demonstrated what many of us have been theorizing about for years based on mechanism. They noted that putting on a moderate amount of muscle reduced the incidence of diabetes by as much as 32%! This means that moderate amounts of muscle mass improve blood sugar content.

Of note, muscle mass that was higher than moderate wasn’t associated with a significant decrease in diabetes risk, but there are many reasons that might be. Some of the strongest individuals have higher BMI, and more body fat content. At a certain point, the muscle and fat content could effectively cancel each other out. That’s more than just conjecture, as you’ll see below. It wasn’t the only study.

There was [a study in 2005](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16286852) which demonstrated an inverse relationship between metabolic syndrome (a condition tightly associated with elevated blood sugars and the development of diabetes) and muscular strength. And, a [2018 Korean study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5999476/) which showed an inverse relationship between hand grip strength and diabetes.

### Decrease Fat

![A woman's body in progression of weight loss. ](/img/og_weight_loss_progression.jpg "A woman's body in progression of weight loss. ")

This one I’ll avoid going into too much detail on. In short, we already know that increasing muscle mass reduces blood sugar and can therefore reduce the risk of diabetes. We also know that losing weight reduces blood sugar and can therefore reduce the risk of diabetes. With those two things, we can safely conclude that the body tissue being lost that’s responsible for the presence of insulin resistance, which raíces your blood sugars and leads to diabetes, is body fat.

Now, not all fat is necessarily bad. The primary bad-actors aren’t just any form of fat. Not all fat will increase one's risk of diabetes significantly. The [bad-actors seem to be visceral fat(referred to as visceral adipose tissue) and liver fat](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6832997/). The mechanism of action is still under investigation and so will not be expanded upon here, but the unfortunate reality is that you lose the visceral and liver fat like any other--eat less, and move more (burn more Calories).

### Increase Exercise

![A woman sprinting, which is one form of high-intensity exercise. ](/img/og_woman_sprinting.jpg "A woman sprinting, which is one form of high-intensity exercise. ")

It may be obvious that energy consumption during exercise will reduce blood sugar, but what about the times you are not exercising?

It turns out that exercising can increase your blood sugar levels for up to three days after exercising! [A 2013 study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3587394/) demonstrated this in addition to some other amazing findings. Hint: if you think you don’t have time to exercise, you probably do. You’re just not doing the right kind!

1. 40 minutes of high intensity exercise at near-maximal interval running per week as much as 150 minutes of moderate exercise.
2. A single session of exercise in a type 2 diabetic improves blood sugars after eating for a whole 24 hours!
3. A two-week exercise program reduces the average blood sugar by 13% at 48 and 72 hours!
4. GLUT4, a receptor in muscle responsible for taking sugar out of the blood at insulin’s demand, is made in much higher quantities--up to 369%!

Exercise is practically magic for blood sugar. And, you literally may start seeing the benefits immediately.

## Summary

That’s the 10,000 foot overview. There is no guarantee that a person will see results if they succeed, but I’ve literally never seen it happen. I’ve had patients reduce their Hemoglobin A1c% from 11.0% to 5.8% in 3 months doing nothing but the above, the only medicine being metformin. And, before you chalk it up to the medicine, know that metformin might give up to a 1.5% reduction at max. That’s not far off what ginger could hypothetically provide.

If you’re motivated and a DIY-er, you could likely do all of this yourself with heavy study and effort. If you’d like some guidance, please feel free to reach out to me, Dr. T (Travis Nesbit, MD).
