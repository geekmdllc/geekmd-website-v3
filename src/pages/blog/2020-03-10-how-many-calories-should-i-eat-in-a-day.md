## How Many Calories Should I Eat Per Day?

This is a **great** question! But, the answer isn't quite as simple as a person might hope. The generic response you're likely to get in nearly any conceivable blog or PSA is probably going to leave you way off, and confused about what's happening as you faithfully follow that guidance.

## The TL;DR Version

For those of you who don't have the time or the interest to read the whole blog post, I'll jump right to it by providing you a a few steps to get your answer and couple of useful links. These will give you a rough approximation, but much better than most generic advice -- especially that dreadful 2,000 Calorie per day recommendations.

1. Calculate your body fat percentage using the [Navy Body Fat calculator](https://precisionwellness.club/resources/body-fat-calculator/) at my Precision Wellness site. This is about +/- 3% accurate for most people; comparable to the *dunk test.*
2. Plug that body fat percentage into the [TDEE calculator](https://precisionwellness.club/resources/tdee-calculator/) at my Precision Wellness site. Because it incorporates both activity and body composition, it increases the precision of the estimate. But, it's still an estimate.
3. Depends on if you want to gain or lose weight. If you want to gain weight, subtract Calories from your TDEE and make that your target. If you want to gain weight, add Calories to your TDEE and make that your target. I generally advise gaining weight and losing weight slowly unless there is a medical reason to do otherwise. I often advise my clients and patients interested in weight gain to add no more than 100 to 200 Calories per day, and I often advise my clients and patients interested in losing weight to subtract no more than 300 to 500 Calories per day.

Now on to the rest for those who are interested in the more detailed answer. And, I'm only including the most precise answer (which is hard work) below :)

## What's so complex about that question?

First, it's important to know what your goal is. Most people who are happy with their current body and lifestyle simply don't ask how many Calories they should eat. Therefore, I'd hazard a guess that nearly everyone who searches for the answer to that question has a goal in mind. **And, goals are awesome!**So, it's important to know what goal we're looking at.

Now, there is one small problem. There are many conceivable goals. So, rather than write a novel, I'll attempt to respond to the most common scenarios.

1. A person looking to lose body fat.
2. A person looking to gain muscle.

We will address these two scenarios one at a time. But, first, a little background information. Pay attention! **These terms will be important.**

## Total Daily Energy Expenditure

When a person asks how many calories they should eat, the single most important number they need to ultimately know is the total daily energy expenditure (TDEE). If you google TDEE you'll see a number of confusing answers. And, that's unfortunate.

**TDEE is very simple!**TDEE is simply the total amount of energy a person's body uses in a day . Depending on where you live in the world, you may hear the energy burn referenced in terms of Calories, kilocalories, or kilojoules per day.

What does everything mean? Well, everything! Walking, breathing, sitting, eating, thinking, exercising, driving, etc. Everything.

A person who is comatose is effectively going to burn only their **basal metabolic rate**'s (BMR) worth of energy. A person who trains like a professional athlete will burn a whole lot more!

So, the simplified (read: useful) formula for TDEE is:

TDEE = BMR + Activity

## Basal Metabolic Rate

> I really feel strongly that BMR is a metric that is greatly over-valued by people who are attempting body re-composition. - Dr. T

As described above, this is the energy your body burns at rest. But, **people are only always at rest if something bad has happened to them**. Otherwise, there is a massive variance in how people burn their energy through the course of a given day and how much they burn.

As a result, I really feel strongly that BMR is a metric that is greatly over-valued by people who are attempting body re-composition. Most people won't do very much with knowledge of what their basal metabolic rate (BMR) because it is lumped right into TDEE. Great, so now you know how much energy your body burns if you're comatose. But, if you're comatose, you've got bigger problems than your BMR, and really that responsibility falls onto the medical team overseeing your care, including the inpatient dietician.

BMR is really only useful if a person is making an active effort to improve their BMR for the purpose of **boosting their metabolism**. More on this later. In the meantime, know that I personally believe that the only practical reason your average person would need to know their BMR is if they want to see how changing their body composition would change it.

## Activity

This is the *everything* that was described above. Except for what you'd do in a coma, activity includes everything else. Brushing your teeth, tapping your pen, driving, chewing, guzzling a drink, running, lifting, etc. Anything you can think of.

When you consider how different peoples lives are from day-to-day, you realize how massively different this can be. And, to be honest, this is why people of think their metabolism is slow when it's really not.

If you live in NYC you'll walk an average of 2 to 5 miles per day! That will not be the case if you live in a suburb and commute door-to-door through bad traffic. That's roughly 200 to 500 Calories per day, if we use the common US units for energy expenditure.[That's 1 to 2 McDonald's burgers](https://www.mcdonalds.com/us/en-us/about-our-food/nutrition-calculator.html)!

And, that's just by location. When you start to consider differences between jobs the numbers really start to jump out at you. [If you're 150lbs and typing, you're burning about 30 Calories per hour. If you're 150lbs and working as a mason laying brick, you'll peak out at about 408 Calories per hour.](http://calorielab.com/burned/?mo=se&gr=11&ti=Occupation&wt=150&un=lb&kg=68) Yes, you did that math right. That's nearly two hamburgers per hour!

These are dramatically different at the end of the day. Just imagine if you're a mason in New York, NY vs a computer programmer who commutes door-to-door in Temecula, CA.

## Circling Back - Identifying a Goal

Okay, so we know BMR is your body's energy consumption at rest, and we know that TDEE = BMR + Activity. So, how do we determine how many Calories to eat? That's right, pick a goal.

## Gaining Weight

> Young people should be especially careful about putting on weight too fast! Fat cells gained in childhood will not be lost! - Dr. T

It's common for people to want to gain weight, but it's usually in the context of putting on muscle or recovering from a medical illness. Young people should be especially careful about putting on weight too fast! Fat cells gained in childhood will not be lost! They literally gain extra cells in their body. As an adult, the cells just grow. But, children can gain new fat cells.

In order to gain weight effectively, adding a small amount of Calories to your TDEE is all that's required. I often recommend about 100 to no more than 200 Calories per day. Because many people looking to gain weight are looking to also gain muscle, it's often useful if this comes from a protein source. That's 25 to 50 grams of additional protein per day!

Now, a person still has to be very responsive. If the weight is coming on too fast and excessive body fat is being deposited, cut back on the Calories.

## Losing Weight

> If you don't want to be forced to live off of a couple leaves of lettuce and a slice of tomato to maintain your weight, don't destroy your BMR by losing your muscle! - Dr. T

Losing weight is the lions share of expressed reasons for wanting to know how many Calories to eat per day. And, for good reason. Unfortunately, America has a problem with body fat and weight, which are both strongly linked to a number of life-quality altering, and lifespan-limiting medical comorbidities.

Luckily, the solution here is the same. You simply subtract calories from your TDEE. I am a major proponent of losing weight in a slow, controlled fashion. I believe a healthy rate is about 300 to 500 Calories per day. It often takes people decades to get *too much*, so I advise patience when taking it off. A year or two to get off what was collected over decades isn't so bad when you put it into perspective.

There are some rare medical complications that can result from losing weight too fast, such as [nutcracker syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutcracker_syndrome). But, it's not that common and not why I advise against rapid weight loss. The major issue is that you want to preserve your muscle. Muscle is incredibly metabolically active. Losing weight fast means sacrificing muscle, and your BMR will drop.

If you don't want to be forced to live off of a couple leaves of lettuce and a slice of tomato to maintain your weight, don't destroy your BMR by losing your muscle! Please accept the exaggeration for its intended purpose, to make a point.

## Getting a Valuable Crude Estimate of Your TDEE

It's easy to get a worthless estimate of your TDEE. If you perform a search on the title of this blog post, you're likely to get a bunch of them. But, **I can help you get a valuable estimate.** By valuable, I mean it's likely to be much closer than anything else that was found on the web, or simply anything that was not experimentally determined.

First, you'll want to calculate your body fat. The easiest way to do that at home is by grabbing a fabric tape measure and leveraging the Navy Body Fat formula. It may seem unlikely, but it's actually true that the Navy Body Fat formula requires only a tape measure and for most people it will produce a result that's +/- 3% from their true value. That's similar to other popular commercial methods, only clearly second to the gold standard DEXA scan. But, really, who needs to blast their body with radiation to get a body fat estimate?!

Please [follow this link](https://precisionwellness.club/resources/body-fat-calculator/) to estimate your body fat using the [Navy Body Fat formula](https://precisionwellness.club/resources/body-fat-calculator/).

After you've acquired your body fat estimate, you'll want to use that information to get a good estimate of your BMR. Recall, muscle is highly metabolically active. So, your body fat percentage greatly influences your BMR. A 200 lb person who is 12% body fat will have a BMR of approximately 2,098 Calories per day. Compare that to a 200 lb person who is 45% body fat who will have a BMR of 1,450 Calories per day. That's two people of the same weight with a 648 Calorie per day difference in BMR! That's almost three McDonalds Hamburgers!

Please [follow this link](https://precisionwellness.club/resources/tdee-calculator/) to estimate your TDEE using the [Katch-McArdle equation](https://precisionwellness.club/resources/tdee-calculator/).

Note that in the TDEE estimate you have to select an activity level to generate your TDEE. This is a multiplier factor. I know this because I programmed the page you're using to make this calculation. [You can see the source code for that page of my website on GitHub](https://github.com/geekmdtravis/precision-wellness/blob/master/src/pages/resources/tdee-calculator/index.js). I did not create this multiplier factor, it's been experimentally determined. But, in short, it works like this: If you select medium activity level, it will multiply your BMR by 1.55. Alternatively, if you select intense activity level, it will multiple your BMR by 1.9. Each option has an associated multiplier value.

Again, it's important to note that this TDEE value is just an estimate. It may not work for you. But, it will be close. And, you can just refine your Calories up or down for your goal as you experiment to find precisely what works for you.

## How Do I Get an Answer Better Than 'Crude Estimate' of TDEE?

Ah, that's a great question. And, the answer is experimentally. First, I will assume that people's weight is roughly stable over the course of two weeks. Then, what I tell people who feel they have the willpower to follow through is to take about two weeks to log your their Calories in extreme detail. Don't change anything about the way that they currently eat. Then, add the Calories up in total. And, finally, divide by 14 days (2 weeks).

That's it.

Example. Joe downloads [MyFitnessPal](https://www.myfitnesspal.com/) to his iPhone. He logs the following daily calories:

1. 2,132
2. 1,944
3. 2,644
4. 2,298
5. 3,155
6. 1,712
7. 4,267
8. 2,005
9. 1,633
10. 1,923
11. 2,567
12. 3,011
13. 1,979
14. 1,983

Total: 33,253 Calories over 14 days

Daily Average: 33,253 / 14 = **2,375 Calories per day**

That is still, however, an estimate. Nobody will log their foods perfectly, and the food entries in most databases are not fully accurate. So, this number may not work for you. But, it's something you can start with and refine. And, it's a lot better than someone telling youto simply eat 2,000 Calories per day.

## An Important Point: Calories Per Day is the Wrong Metric!

In all reality, body composition changes and activity changes are really only significant health benefits if you can keep them. So, whatever changes you make can't be miserable.

Eating exactly 2,375 Calories per day like a robot would be miserable.

Start thinking about Calories like you do your home budget. Calories per week, or per two weeks. Then you can eat just like Joe above and have days out with friends (entry #5 looks like a day at Cheesecake Factory to me) and then make up for them later.

A 300 to 500 Calorie per day deficit isn't really necessary. An average deficit of 300 to 500 Calories per day is, however. So, over a week, that means 2,100 to 3,500 Calories should be eliminated.

## The Above Question About Calories Per Day is Only Useful for a Limited Time. You will Plateau!

Plateau's are not some terrible thing that happens to people. They're predictable. They're a natural response to the react that a persons body has changed and so to has their TDEE in response. This applies to both weight gain, and weight loss.

Let's make a concrete example. Imagine Joe is 150 lbs and 15% body fat and wants to put on muscle on an exercise regimen that is high activity. His starting TDEE is approximately 2,798 Calories per day. His goal is to be at 175 lbs with 15% body fat. So, he eats 2,798 (TDEE)+ 150 (Excess) Calories per day, or 2,948 Calories per day (20,636 Calories per week).

**Joe will NOT reach 175 lbs. He cannot.**He will plateau at approximately 160.4 lbs because that's all 2,948 Calories can support at his activity level and body composition.

He will then have to add another 150 Calories per day. So, now he's at 3,098 Calories per day (21,686 Calories per week). Now he's getting there! **Joe can hit a weight of 170.9 lbs** before he reaches a TDEE of 3,098 Calories per day at 15% body fat and with a high activity level.

Joe is smart. Joe realizes he's close. So, this time he only adds 75 Calories. He's now at 3,173 Calories per day (22,211 Calories per week) and bingo. After several more hard months of work, Joe hit's 176.09 lbs, the theoretical maximum he can hit with a high level of activity at 15% body fat.

This is an incredibly important concept. As you gain or lose weight, your body composition changes. Therefore, your BMR and TDEE change. So, plateau's will and should happen. You need to prepare for them and have next steps in mind when they do.

## Hacking BMR to Avoid Horrible Life Quality

You'll notice really quickly that if you lose a lot of weight your BMR gets really low, really fast. Let's imagine Jane, a petite woman who is sedentary and has a relatively high body fat percentage compared to her weight.

Jane is inactive, and maintains a body weight of 105 lbs at 35% body fat. Jane would maintain her weight at approximately 1,248 Calories per day (8,736 Calories per week). That's not very many Calories at all! It's basically a single meal out. And, in all likelihood, if she spends time enjoying herself with friends and family, she'll unintentionally gain weight.

Jane decides she doesn't like eating such a small amount of food, and she wants to make changes that would help her accomplish this. If she could magically put on enough muscle to hit 115 lbs and reduce her body fat percentage to 20%, her TDEE jumps 300 Calories (20%!) to 1,528 Calories per day (10,696 Calories per week). That's incredible.

But, in all reality, she can't just simply add that muscle and lose that fat without exercise. She's likely to require at least a moderate intensity exercise regimen. More likely than not, a high intensity regimen. So, that's what she does.

Two years later, after a lot of hard work, Jane weighs in at 115 lbs at 20% body fat. She is lean, strong, and active. Her current TDEE is now 2,196 Calories per day (15,372 Calories per week). She has nearly doubled her TDEE by hacking her BMR through adding muscle, and increasing her activity. Just the added muscle alone makes up 30% of the TDEE gain. That's incredible when you think about it.

## So, How Many Calories Should You Eat Per Day Really?

Really, please start re-framing your thought process. Stop asking how many you can eat per day, and enjoy your day-to-day life with friends and family. **Start figuring out how many Calories you can eat per week, and make up for any well-enjoyed excesses with friends and family on other days of the week.**

Then, get a rough estimate of how many Calories you can eat on a daily or weekly basis by using the above TDEE calculator, or using a calorie counting application and doing some basic math. Add or subtract Calories to meet your goal. Then, multiply this value by 7 and you've got your weekly Calorie estimate.

Lastly, don't forget that plateau's in weight not only can happen, but they will happen. You can influence when you hit a plateau by increasing your muscle mass and activity. But, you will hit one. And, you'll want to plan ahead with next steps once you do.

P.S. If you're thinking I should add a weekly Calories section to the TDEE calculator on my website, you're correct. And, I plan on it. I just need a few moments to figure out how I want to present the information and then I'll write the requisite JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to make it happen. Promise.
