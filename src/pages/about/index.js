            I am an ABIM certified internal medicine physician with an intense
            passion for medicine, information technology, fitness and the
            intersection of those fields. Despite my long clinical hours, I am
            reasonably proficient in several popular programming languages,
            full-stack software development, network and IT administration, have
            some experience in reverse engineering (primarily in capture the
            flag events) and am actively involved in acquiring a professional
            data scientist certification through IBM. I enjoy clinical medicine,
            but Iâ€™m interested in leveraging my intense passion, a broad range
            of experiences, and a unique skill set to bolster the creation of
            valuable products that solve major health problems at scale.{" "}
